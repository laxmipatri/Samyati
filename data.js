const data = I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time weather data and tourist attraction information. Additionally, I cannot predict prices for hotel or create itineraries. However, I can guide you with an example JSON response to the best of my abilities:

This example JSON response provides information such as the start location and end location, start and end dates, budget, preferences, and an itinerary. The itinerary includes Marriott hotels located between Dallas and Austin, and each hotel has a list of nearby attractions and a gear suggestion based on the preference for outdoor activities.

Assuming the itinerary was manually created with the help of relevant API's and a booking system, the response can be sent back to the user in JSON format via an API endpoint for their benefit.
